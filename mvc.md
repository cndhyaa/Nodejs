Model :
Model is simply the structure(or a data structure) . Model code typically reflects real-world things. 


 View: View is something that we see in the interface. View is made up of all the functions that directly interact with the user.
 
 
 Controller: Controller is something that have control over things. Controller acts as a liaison between the Model and the View, receiving user input and deciding what to do with it. Itâ€™s the brains of the application, and ties together the model and the view.
